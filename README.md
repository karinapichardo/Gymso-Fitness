# Gymso-Fitness

Recreated a commercial website designed by tooplate!
 
This project was very fun to do, I got to practice with flexbox and css grid. Likewise, I practiced creating responsive tables. 

# Key takeaways:

#### I learned about SVGS and the power they have, like being able to style them however you'd like and how they're able to scale no matter their size.

#### I learned how to incorporate google maps into my sites which was really cool.

#### I learned how to create a hamburger menu.

Adding a hamburger menu to my site for mobile devices and then having to hide it for larger screens, really got me thinking about how important user experience is, I gained an appreciation for making things easy, simple and accessible to everyone.

### I'm starting to see the real purpose and beauty of responsive web design, which is incredible.
